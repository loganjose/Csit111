        <h1>My little pony friendship is magic</h1>
        <h2>it defined a generation</h2>

        <h3>backstory or mlp fim</h3>
        <p>this may seem weird but it important to know this to learn how the show turned out as good as it is</p>
        <ul>
            <li> There have been many mlp shows since the 80s and while a lot of them have there charm in my opinion. however i also would not consider them steller</li>
            <li> in the late 2000s there was a new net work called the hub that was a joint vernture between hasbro and discorvery family</li>
            <li> hasbro is about to start a revamp of the mlp franchise and they want a show to go with it </li>
            <li> at the same time lauren faust a big name in the animation industry she amd her husband  wrote some of the most beloved cartoons in the 90s through 2000s</li>
            <li> lauren wants too pitch a new show called milky way and the galaxy girls to hasbro hasbro instead offers her up the role for writing the new my little pony show </li>
            <li> an angry person from the cartoon review site cartoon brew wrote ended up writng an angry arctile called the death of creator driven animation</li>
            <li> a lot of people heard about this and wanted to see how it actually was based of this article but because since it had talenet behind it it allowed many who may have not scene it to watch it and they found it good </li>
    
        </ul>
        <h4>My review of the show</h4>
        <p>the show primarly revolves around twilight sparkle and her group of six friends living in the magical world of equestria.twilight sparkle the main charecter is sent to ponyville in the first episode in order to 
            to prepare for the annual summer sun celebration in ponyville by her mentor figure princess celestia of canterlot while origanally she is there strictly for buisness she five ponies which will end up being her friends throughout the rest of the show 
            her and her newly founed friends have to go on an adventure to stop her mentors sister gone evil called nightmare moon. she and her friends solves each element of the enter using there element of harmoney to help solve there obsticles and help to reform the villanous 
            nightmare moon back into princess luna. twilight then chooses to stay in ponyville for the rest of the series as instructed by celestia for the rest of the series.each episode mainly revolves around twilight one of her friends or the rest of the main six having an learning about 
            friendship by either going on a quest or doing something about ponyville. the show just has a certian charm that cant be beat in my opinion all of the charecters are just so likeable and relatable there all have a personality that just gets you to latch onto them.
            and you would think that storys about friendship seem like it would just be something for little kids but it goes more indepth about what it is like to be a good friend and its not only that but throughout the show we watch as these charecters grow and make it through tough challanges 
            something that really speaks to me is its way in handling insecurities, a good example of this is season 1 episode 14 where the charecter of rarity is making dresses for all of her friends for the big party at the end of the season we see her orignal designs which look very well done
            but her friends want to make all these changes that makes the dresses look dumb and poorly built and they eventually learn that rarity needs to put her foot down and her friends learn not to expect too much from her. this episode speaks to me because im always concerned about pleasing people
            and not disappoiting anyone but when your constantly trying to please people you end up not delivering your best result. theres more i have to say but the lists below will help explain a lot more of my thoughts

        <h5>ranking the seasons of the show from best to worst</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Season 2
            <p>just prime mlp in its best this was just the best of the classic eras my favorite episodes of the show are in this season
                its the one i go back to the most often there are episodes here. season 1 was good too but it did have to suffer a bit from
                being the first seaon of the show most shows have a little bit of growing pains. it was inventive and creative without losing
                to much of the simplistic charm. twilight had her best episodes in this one in my opinion so did fluttershy all of the charecters 
                felt genuine.and its nice to hear more from the other main six in mlp since now they all write letters to celestia not just twilight
                i watched this one as a kid so nostligia plays a factor as well and the show was at the hight of its cultural relevence. the only downside 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Season 1 
            <p>

            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Season 4</li>
            <li>Season 5
            <p>This season was the first to have a lot of major changes to the show firstly twilight has a castle now unlike the library that she used to live in
                and a new concept with the charecter traveling all throughout equestria for diffrent quests to resolve friendship problem by this point all of the 
                main six have progessed a lot so this honestly makes sense they all have pretty good episodes i 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>season 7</li>
            <li>season 6</li>
            <li>season 3</li>
            
            <li>season 9
            <p>this was the last season and how did they do? they did alright a lot of problems from season 8 still creep in there is too many charecters to keep track of
                i dont like some of the plot points in this one either i dislike the idea of the princesses retireing and leaving twilight to fend for herself kind of thing. 
                it espically annoys me given the fact that they are immortal there is nothing that could prevent them from still helping out. The charecters have most of there 
                achivements accomplished within this season 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>season 8
            <p>now despite being the worst ranked there are several episodes that i did like and its not all bad but this is when the show felt like it was running on fumes
                they stared adding so many charecters it was geinually just getting too much they added a grand total of 14 new charecters and neglected the ones it already had 
                all of the mane 6 are now teachers which is a dumb plot point the whole enjoyment that i got out of the first 4 seasons and even 5-7 was following the charecters 
                the mane six and a couple of side charecters on there journey now we need to follow these dumb other charecters. there is also so many episodes in this season that
                they just feel like there trying to relive the glory days with episodes that are kind of simaler as some of the old classics but now they suck.one thing that really 
                annoys me about this season is they really reached the appex of giving pinkie pie one of my favorite charecters in the show the worst episodes it genuiannlly feels 
                like they could not write her any more.
