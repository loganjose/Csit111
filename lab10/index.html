    <h1>What is xml and js?</h1>
    <h2 style="font-size: large;">What is xml?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Xml basically stores info it does not actually do anything on its own.</li>
    <li>it basically is a simple way to store and send info and xml doesnt actually store any info on how to be displayed either. </li>
    <li> xml is used a lot within web design as its an easy way to store and send data.</li>
    <li>xml is also resitant to change because of its design its easy to add or change the way the data is used.</li>
    <li>so for instance if you redesigned a website you could still use the same xml file to grab data from you just change the output is viewed.</li>
    
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: larger;">Example of xml</h2>
<img src="bookstorexml.JPG" alt="image of xml file">
<ul>
<li>Above is an example of xml from W3schools.</li>
<li>unlike html xml does not have predefined tags.</li>
<li>The tags are more or less just there to indentify certian fuctions of the data.</li>
<li>every xml file starts with a root element in this case bookstore.</li>
<li> and then it desclates into lower elemets like catagory title author etc.</li>
<li>this makes it easier to make new data as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is javascript?</h3>
<ul>
<li>firstly javascript and java are 2 different things but they do share some properties they are diffrent though.</li>
<li>javascript adds complex fuctionalty to web pages.</li>
<li>javascript is considered a client side programming languge since most of the code runs within your browser.</li>
<li>its used a lot in webpages but also for ios and andriod development.</li>
<li>javascript also works with html and css so for instance you can style a button made with javascript with css.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold ;font-family:sans-serif">some of those complex tasks include...</p>
<ul>
    <li>searching a database </li>
    <li>build games</li>
    <li>make a countdowntimer</li>
    <li>rotating through images in a slide show</li>
    <li>buttons</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="font-size: larger; font-family:sans-serif;"> Javascript elements, properties, methods, and functions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>an element is basically the over all base of the javascript file its basically a variable that it pulls info from.</li>
    <li>properties basically the info from those elements for instance in both java and javascript a len properties would tell you how long an element it.</li>
    <li>methods basically take and change an element so for instance there is a method called concatonation that takes two elements and puts them together 
        so you could put in both a first name and last name and it could turn it into a full name.</li>
    <li>lastly a fuction is a block of reusable code that allows you to preform diffrent actions so for instance you could use a fuction to generate a random number in range
        to simulate a dice roll.
    </li>
