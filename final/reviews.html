        <h2 style="text-align: center;">It defined a generation</h2>
        <h4 style="font-size: larger;">My review of the show</h4>
        <p>the show primarly revolves around twilight sparkle and her group of six friends living in the magical world of equestria.twilight sparkle the main charecter is sent to ponyville in the first episode in order to 
            to prepare for the annual summer sun celebration in ponyville by her mentor figure princess celestia of canterlot while origanally she is there strictly for buisness she five ponies which will end up being her friends throughout the rest of the show 
            her and her newly founed friends have to go on an adventure to stop her mentors sister gone evil called nightmare moon. she and her friends solves each element of the enter using there element of harmoney to help solve there obsticles and help to reform the villanous 
            nightmare moon back into princess luna. twilight then chooses to stay in ponyville for the rest of the series as instructed by celestia for the rest of the series.each episode mainly revolves around twilight one of her friends or the rest of the main six having an learning about 
            friendship by either going on a quest or doing something about ponyville. the show just has a certian charm that cant be beat in my opinion all of the charecters are just so likeable and relatable there all have a personality that just gets you to latch onto them.
            and you would think that storys about friendship seem like it would just be something for little kids but it goes more indepth about what it is like to be a good friend and its not only that but throughout the show we watch as these charecters grow and make it through tough challanges 
            something that really speaks to me is its way in handling insecurities, a good example of this is season 1 episode 14 where the charecter of rarity is making dresses for all of her friends for the big party at the end of the season we see her orignal designs which look very well done
            but her friends want to make all these changes that makes the dresses look dumb and poorly built and they eventually learn that rarity needs to put her foot down and her friends learn not to expect too much from her. this episode speaks to me because im always concerned about pleasing people
            and not disappoiting anyone but when your constantly trying to please people you end up not delivering your best result. theres more i have to say but the lists below will help explain a lot more of my thoughts 
        </p>
        <h5 style="font-size: larger;">ranking the seasons of the show from best to worst</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Season 2
            <p>just prime mlp in its best this was just the best of the classic eras my favorite episodes of the show are in this season
                its the one i go back to the most often there are episodes here. season 1 was good too but it did have to suffer a bit from
                being the first seaon of the show most shows have a little bit of growing pains. it was inventive and creative without losing
                to much of the simplistic charm. this one raised the steaks and made things more intersting without haveing the show lose its simplistic charm 
                twilight had her best episodes in this one in my opinion so did fluttershy all of the charecters 
                felt genuine.and its nice to hear more from the other main six in mlp since now they all write letters to celestia not just twilight
                i watched this one as a kid so nostligia plays a factor as well and the show was at the height of its cultural relevence. the only downside
                is that this season has the worst episode in my opinion its called dragon quest which makes it sound cool but it just relentlsly beats down on
                a charecter and has uncomfortable unintentional connotations.the season also has one of my favorite 2 parters called a canterlot wedding and this
                is a lot cooler then it sounds.The hype for the show was it its highest too.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Season 1 
            <p>nice start to the show there are definatly some growing pains but you can tell they where putting a lot of effort into the show. the charecters are all pretty well
                realized and add a lot to the show feeling special.its nice just to sort of chill with these charecters its got that slice of life vibe with some adenturing aspects too it as well 
                was definatly problems however it was annoying having twilight shoved into every episode because this was before the main six 
                just all wrote letters too celestia.I know i said that this as a negitive earlier but its weird not having someoff the charecter from the later season the scopes pretty small we barly even leave ponyville
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Season 4</li>
            <p>
                The last of what the fans consider the golden area of the show. This was the last one to truely the last one to have the writing style and storys that would feel in place with the first three 
                they are starting to raise the stakes a lot more here. this is before some major show events happen like twilight getting a castle and rainbow dash fully joining the wonder bolts etc. 
                there where very few i actually disliked here too so its good to me that. and they added like a new motif here with a special object each of the main six get when they complete a certian mission 
                to unlock a box that was gotten at the begnnining of the seris nice bit of contonutiy even if all the key episodes where not the best.
            </p>
            <li>season 3</li>
            <p>despite being part of the classic era this seasons reception was mixed there are definatly good episodes in here but the season was very short and this was around the time 
                that lauren faust the og creator kinda took a step back to work on other projects like dc super hero girls. and the show took a blow here. id still say i enjoyed a majority of episodes
                but some episodes where really boring in this one they introduce a new kingdom that princess cadence now rules over which is cool but i kinda wished for more development with her after the amazingness of a canterlot wedding
                i expected more from her
            </p>
            <li>Season 5</li>
            <p>This season was the first to have a lot of major changes to the show firstly twilight has a castle now unlike the library that she used to live in
                and a new concept with the charecter traveling all throughout equestria for diffrent quests to resolve friendship problem by this point all of the 
                main six have progessed a lot so this honestly makes sense and most episodes with this concept are pretty good. however the show is starting to get 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>season 7</li>
            <p>this one was pretty solid one of the better of the later season rhis is before they went too far in season 8 with like 90000 charecters and it nicely expands upon season 6
                its just mostly expanding upon the lore and worldbuilding not that much new was added which its nice.
            </p>
            
            <li>season 6</li>
            <p>
                not bad but not my favorite either there are some gems in here if you look but i forgot a lot about this season right after watching there is good stuff in here if you look for it 
                there was a decent amount of stuff here that felt shoehorned in by hasbro as well like them adding a baby alicorn princess which felt so much like marketing 
                 
            </p>

            <li>season 9
            <p>this was the last season and how did they do? they did alright a lot of problems from season 8 still creep in there is too many charecters to keep track of
                i dont like some of the plot points in this one either i dislike the idea of the princesses retireing and leaving twilight to fend for herself kind of thing. 
                it espically annoys me given the fact that they are immortal there is nothing that could prevent them from still helping out. The charecters have most of there 
                achivements accomplished within this season 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>season 8</li>
            <p>now despite being the worst ranked there are several episodes that i did like and its not all bad but this is when the show felt like it was running on fumes
                they stared adding so many charecters it was geinually just getting too much they added a grand total of 14 new charecters and neglected the ones it already had 
                all of the mane 6 are now teachers which is a dumb plot point the whole enjoyment that i got out of the first 4 seasons and even 5-7 was following the charecters 
                the mane six and a couple of side charecters on there journey now we need to follow these dumb other charecters. there is also so many episodes in this season that
                they just feel like there trying to relive the glory days with episodes that are kind of simaler as some of the old classics but now they suck.one thing that really 
                annoys me about this season is they really reached the appex of giving pinkie pie one of my favorite charecters in the show the worst episodes it genuiannlly feels 
                like they could not write her any more.
