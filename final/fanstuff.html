            <h3>Backstory of mlp fim</h3>
            <p>This may seem weird but it important to know this to learn how the show turned out as good as it is</p>
            <ul>
                <li> There have been many mlp shows since the 80s and while a lot of them have there charm in my opinion. however i also would not consider them steller</li>
                <li> in the late 2000s there was a new net work called the hub that was a joint vernture between hasbro and discorvery family</li>
                <li> hasbro is about to start a revamp of the mlp franchise and they want a show to go with it </li>
                <li> at the same time lauren faust a big name in the animation industry she amd her husband  wrote some of the most beloved cartoons in the 90s through 2000s</li>
                <li> lauren wants too pitch a new show called milky way and the galaxy girls to hasbro hasbro instead offers her up the role for writing the new my little pony show </li>
                <li> an angry person from the cartoon review site cartoon brew wrote ended up writng an angry arctile called the death of creator driven animation</li>
                <li> a lot of people heard about this and wanted to see how it actually was based of this article but because since it had talenet behind it it allowed many who may have not scene it to watch it and they found it good </li>
                <li> and at first a lot of people where origanally looking at it ironically but it eventually became genuine </li>
                <li> due to this whole string of events it invited a lot of people who would have origanally not watched the show to give it a chance </li>
                <li> this lead to conventions, art, fanfictions and animations. i have listed a few of my favorite fan works below </li>
            </ul>
